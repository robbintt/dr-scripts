# 4 Magics (YAML trains everything but Sorcery)
# - suggested first spell is Aura Of Tongues to train utility.
# - the WAGGLE section contains basic information on Intro and Beginner bard buffs.
# - At 11th circle, you lose access to AP spells unless you learn them from a scroll.
# 2 Weapons required (trains Brawling, Light Thrown, Crossbow, Small Edged)
# 1 Armor (trains Chain Armor, Shield Usage)
# 4 Survivals required (trains Perception, Skinning, Athletics, Evasion, First Aid, can add Stealing and Locksmithing with Burgle)
# 2 specific Lores: Performance and Bardic Lore
# 3 other Lores (trains Appraisal, Tactics, Scholarship, Engineering)

# Gear used in YAML: 
# -Crossing chain armor, shield, parry stick, and weapons. 
# -Haversack from Wolf Clan (used in BURGLE). 
# -Worn-knife from Knife Clan. Zills from Riverhaven.
# -Basic engineering tools, logbook, and shaping instructions book.
# -Get a compendium, either from burgle or a friendly empath, as soon as possible.  
#  Delete the comment '#' for First Aid in crossing_training (around line 235) and T2 (around line 660).
#  Change "testbook_type" to the noun for your compendium. (raound line 215)

# NOTES:
#    - You can find all the BASE settings inside the base.yaml within this same folder! Search the file for keywords for more settings!
#    - If you can "TAP ADJECTIVE NOUN" for an item, then you can use that for the adjective & noun of the item within the scripts!

# High-level example YAMLS:
